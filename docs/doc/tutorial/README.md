# Getting started


# Set up a search engine server in a few steps


## Open Semantic Desktop Search



If you are an user and want only search for yourself, you maybe want to use the [Open Semantic Desktop Search virtual maschine](../desktop_search) or the [encrypted Live-System InvestigateIX](http://www.mandalka.name/investigateix/), which is easier to install for single end users.



## Open Semantic Search Server



The [Open Semantic Search Server installation tutorial shows how to setup a search engine as a public website or on an intranet server](../admin/install/search_server) for admins running a Debian GNU/Linux or Ubuntu Linux (web)server or within an existing virtual maschine.


# Search, explore, analyze and filter


Enter a [search query](../search/operators) and enjoy the interactive [userinterface for navigation, faceted search, exploratory search, interactive filters, analytics and visualizations](../search).

You will find [flexible config options in the config files](../admin/config) in `/etc/opensemanticsearch/`.
