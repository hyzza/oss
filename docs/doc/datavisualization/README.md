# Data visualization


## Datavisualization of search results or analytics results



Integrated visualization tools to visualize data or visualize text with charts, graphs or wordclouds:

## Trend chart (how many documents when)


[Trend chart](../analyze/trend): When how many results or documents?

## Networks, relations and connections (graph visualization)


The [visual graph explorer for graph visualization, discovery and exploration of connections](../analytics/graph) generates data visualizations of networks, connections and relations between named entities like persons, organizations or tags from the content of your documents.

## Open Source Datavisualization tools for quantitative data


Open Semantic Search focus is on information retrieval, text analysis and text mining of mostly qualitative data from text documents wherefore the data sources can be vast amounts or masses of documents and considering their size of the corpus or data volume big data, too.

But for interactive data analytics and datavisualizations of quantitative data like numbers and diagrams you should use other open source data analytics and data visualization tools like [Apache Zeppelin](https://zeppelin.apache.org) supporting different data stores, [Kibana for Elastic Search](http://www.elastic.co/de/products/kibana) or Banana for Solr focused more on numbers and quantity than on text and quality.
