# Scheduling (Cron)


## Cron


If you use our connectors, just add Cron jobs using the command line tools the standard Linux way.

## Preconfigured cron jobs


### Import RSS feeds


With the next version with integrated user interfaces for data import there will be a preconfigured Cron job that will look every minute for RSS feeds where the configured delta time is over, to import them again.

## Apache ManifoldCF


If you use ManifoldCF connectors, you have to schedule them in the user interface of ManifoldCF, which has its own scheduler.
