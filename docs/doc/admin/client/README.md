# Client integration


## Browser integration


To spare some seconds to call the search engine bookmark to get the search interface you can easily integrate the search with the web browser search field (i.e. Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, Chrome or Opera) via OpenSearch standard.

## Desktop integrated search


If you use Unity or Gnome as your Linux Desktop, you can integrate search results to the search lenses, so can search pressing just a key anf fully integrated with your desktop instead of having to start a client or browser and to call the URL.

## Filemanager


If you don't use [filesystem monitoring](../../../trigger/filemonitoring) for indexing all changes automatically, it is possible to integrate to start indexing files easily and comfortable with the context menu of your standard filemanager (i.e. Explorer in Windows or Nautilus in Debian or Ubuntu Linux)
