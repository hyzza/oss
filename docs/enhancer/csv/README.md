# CSV Spreadsheets


Enhanced by this module you can not only find content of the CSV file but use or filter the structure of a CSV spreadsheet or table while searching.

So a CSV (comma seperated values) spreadsheet or table can not only be found as a single file where one word of the search query is in a row and another word of the search query in another row so that the whole file would be found even if the data of both rows is not connected, but you can search for queries that should be found in rows instead of the full CSV table.

Additionally you can browse trough the rows and filter columns with the comfortable [table view](../../doc/search/table).

This module supports a good working auto-detection of the encoding or charset of the CSV file and a less good working auto-detection of the CSV dialect.
