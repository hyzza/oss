# Enhancer ZIP


This enhancer recognizes ZIP archives to unzip its content and index each file inside the zip file, too.

So it extends the possibility to search for the ZIP file itself and its metadata like the contained filenames to be able to find the full contents of zipped documents, presentations and all other files within the archive file, too.

Additionally all files inside the ZIP-archive will be enhanced by all other configured enhancers, too. I.e. with the OCR enhancer for automatic text recognition for images even inside the ZIP files.
