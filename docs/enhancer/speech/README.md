# Speech recognition for audio files


This data enrichment plugin extracts text from speech in audio or sound files like WAV or MP3 so it there are findable by content automatically even if not tagged.

For privacy issues it does not upload your file to cloud services. So you can use this plugin even offline without any internet connection.

Todo: This plugin works at the moment only for short audio files. For very long audios please wait, until the plugin will integrate a tool, which cuts too long audios into parts (which should be between words in a certain time, not exactly after a certain time).
